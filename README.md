# Flo: Financial Life Orchestrator

Flo is an intelligent, agentic system designed to help you manage your entire financial life—not just as an assistant, but as a proactive partner in your financial decisions.

## ⚠️ Development Status

**This project is currently in a testing & eval phase.**

Please be aware that Flo is an experimental application. Features may change, and the current version is not recommended for managing real financial data. It is intended for demonstration and development purposes only.

## What is Flo?

Flo's goal is to create a seamless **flow** in your financial life, moving beyond simple transaction logging or budgeting. It's designed to help you make informed financial decisions, as many actions in life correspond with money.

Traditional finance apps often act as simple ledgers, requiring manual input and providing limited insight. Flo is built on a powerful **agentic architecture**.

The name **Flo** stands for **Financial Life Orchestrator**.

## Core Features

- **Natural Language Interaction:** Simply talk to Flo as your friend.
    
- **Transaction Management:** Easily record income and expenses, and retrieve transaction history.
    
- **Budget Management:** Set and manage monthly income and expense budgets.
    
- **Financial Goal Setting:** Define and track saving, spending limit, or income goals.
    
- **Liability Tracking:** Record and manage lump-sum or installment liabilities (debts).
    
- **Wishlist Management:** Keep track of items you want or need to buy, including estimated prices and priority.
    
- **Financial Advice:** Get answers to finance-related questions using integrated search capabilities.
    
- **Stateful Memory:** Flo remembers your profile (name, language, currency) and balance across conversations for a personalized experience.
    
- **Optional Observability (For Developer):** Integrated with Langfuse to provide clear observability into agent performance and behavior for developers.
    

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your own Flo instance running locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13+**
    
- **uv** (can be installed via `pipx` or `pip`)
    
- A **Google API Key** for Gemini Models.

### For Standard Users

These instructions will get the application running without the development and observability tools.

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/AIter-Team/Flo
    cd flo
    ```
    
2. **Create and Sync the Environment:**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    uv sync
    ```
    
3. **Configure API Keys:**
    
    - Create a `.env` file from the example: `cp .env.example .env`
        
    - Open `.env` and add your `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.
        
4. **Activate and Run:**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    source .venv/bin/activate
    python -m src.main
    ```

### For Developers (with Observability)

These instructions include installing `langfuse` for tracing and debugging the agents.

1. **Clone the Repository and `cd` into it.**
    
2. **Create and Sync the Full Development Environment:**
    
    - The `--all-extras` flag tells `uv` to install the optional `[dev]` dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`.
        
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    uv sync --all-extras
    ```
    
3. **Configure API Keys:**
    
    - Create a `.env` file: `cp .env.example .env`
        
    - Open `.env` and add your **`GOOGLE_API_KEY`**, **`LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`**, and **`LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`**.
        
4. **Activate and Run:**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    source .venv/bin/activate
    uv run python -m src.main
    # You will see a message that Langfuse is enabled.
    ```
    

## How to Use?

Flo runs as an interactive command-line application.

1. **Start the Application:** From the root of the project directory, run the main script:
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    uv run python -m src.main
    ```
    
2. **Interact with Flo:** Once running, you can start a conversation. Here are some examples:
    
    - **Initial Setup (if new user):** Flo will ask for your name, language, and currency preference.
        
    - **Record an expense:**
        
        > `User: I bought groceries for 50 dollars`
        
    - **Record an income:**
        
        > `User: I received my salary of 2000`
        
    - **Ask for your balance:**
        
        > `User: What's my current balance?`
        
    - **Retrieve transactions:**
        
        > `User: How much did I spend on food last week?`
        
    - **Set a monthly budget:**
        
        > `User: I want to set my monthly budget`
        
    - **Set a financial goal:**
        
        > `User: I want to save up for a new laptop`
        
    - **Add a liability:**
        
        > `User: I need to record my car loan`
        
    - **Add to wishlist:**
        
        > `User: I want to buy a new gaming console`
